## These are the expression levels for all the genes. I can calculate the average of all of these. But.. how do I get the counts for each time point...
# May have to retrace my steps on the jupytr notebook again.

I aligned the 12 fastq files (from SRR's) via STAR.
The SRR's are mostly from time courses.
how to get time course positions back out from counts table?

GFF does not have SRR numbers... sad

A radical idea. Run STAR alignment on all the bam files individually. Run them all through hiseq. (done)

And then see from there which ones from the count_data(master) match the ones in the 12. Filtering merged_data counts for rows that are within the 12 time points


Figured it out. see creation of AVGEXPLVL.ALL. Running the 12 separately was the key. (ended up only using the last 11 though, since only those had A-V)
