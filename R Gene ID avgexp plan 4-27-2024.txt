--IDENTIFYING GENES--
Counts table: First, use read.table() for the .txt table (from htseq output)
Annotation table: then, read.delim() for .gff
then, save as vectors gene IDs from count data (rownames), get gene IDs from annotation (a column from the gff dataframe)
find common gene IDs by finding the intersection between these two vectors.
then, filter the count data (table) for only the rows that match the common gene IDs.
	* I should check if finding only the genes that are present in the gff is the correct way to "identify the genes"
	* The GFFAnno$attributes has "ID=...;Name=.." or "ID=;Parent=". This ID/Name combo is what we need to match the count_data rownames (ID...) with.

--CALCULATING AVG EXP LEVELS--
Using another method.
Not rowMeans. The format of the .txt output is just one expression value per row.

--ADDITIONAL STUFF--

"Identify all the genes in these regions" --> Need to make a dataframe or something that has the names of the genes that match. see above


So Chat has already guessed some centromere positions. Let's come up with the code first, and then change it as required as I find the actual positions.
 (Fixed. I hafve gotten the actual centromere positions, etc... So much has happened, so for further progress just read the .Rmd)
