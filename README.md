# BrarAvgGeneExp-2024
My Spring 2024 term project for NYU's Applied Genomics graduate course (M.S. Biology). Using data from Brar et al, this is a determination and analysis of average gene expression from the pericentromeric, subtelomeric, and centromeric regions of Chromosomes I to XVI on Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) during traditional time course meiosis.
