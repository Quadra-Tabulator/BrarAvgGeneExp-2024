Problems to fix:

1. perhaps stranded option should be checked

2. Perhaps GFF-related arguments should be checked.
--type option

Third column has stuff other than exon. It has gene, CDS, etc. So use --type gene. BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR GENES... wow

Use --idattr ID or Parent. Because it is not simply called "gene_id" (THIS COULD'VE SOLVED MY "no gene id, must extract it myself" PROBLEM.) MIGHT SOLVE THIS LACK OF PARENT NAME PROBLEM TOO. (already done. -i ID)
