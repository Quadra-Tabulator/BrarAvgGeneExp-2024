Modifications to the project:

.fa and .gff files are in Dr H's email. I have put them in HPC

Don't trim anymore. It causes data loss and the Brar paper has no mention of it.

Go directly to FastQC (quality checker)

Use HISAT or STAR to align for this RNA-seq instead of BWA.

After that I presume is where I download all the data and work on it via RStudio. I can probably download them to the external SSD.







Note to self: Workflow for FASTQ alignments (from HW2)

load modules, get all the .fastq files (from SRR on NCBI GEO. get list if needed)
FastQC
STAR to align (uses .fa file directly and has higher rate than HISAT2)
Download data and continue on RStudio






Will likely have to either:
1. within the sbatch, make the read align part a loop that runs STAR over all the files at once https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D1dToIQqls

for file in *.fastq
do
STAR --runMode alignReads --genomeDir [whatever i made it. probably SK] --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --readFilesIn ${file} --runThreadN 12 --outFileNamePrefix [whatever i set it to]
done


[Not using this] 2. add a line that writes the names of the .fastq files into a .txt file, and then make the output of the txt file become the input of the read align. (this seems much harder/more complex)

outSAM type as BAM might save a lot of space
