- What do I do with the BAM files afterwards?

 - Get the counts. BAM files have align and what they align to
 - Get COUNT table from the BAM files before RStudio offline (htseq-count. This is a module on the HPC cluster. htseq-count from HTSeq still on the cluster. Keep working on this in Bash/Jupytr)

 - BAM file and GTF file. A table of counts and GTF annotations.		

GFF and GTF files are interchangeable if required by a program.

Can I use BAM files instead for htseq? YES --format
